# arctic char*

based on [nadako](https://github.com/nadako)'s [hello-sdlgpu3-odin](https://github.com/nadako/hello-sdlgpu3-odin).

as much as possible from Odin's core / vendor libaries are being used here:

- SDL3, Windows, Audio, GPU, etc.
- stb/easy_font for bare bones text rendering
- cgltf for glb/gltf loading

using [SDL_shadercross](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_shadercross) to compile shaders to different platforms.

TODO:
- Support more than just Metal
- Sounds on button press rather than just looping WAV
- Player input
- Sprites / images
